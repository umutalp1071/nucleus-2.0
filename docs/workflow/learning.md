## 2026-07-26 — Phase 1, Day 1: Dashboard Foundation

**What we did:**
Built the dashboard UI foundation (header, new-idea/stats panel, active projects list, recent activity/growth/quick-actions row) using the full Plan → Discuss → Implement → Review → Refine cycle. Zero new dependencies — reused the existing Tailwind theme tokens instead of installing shadcn/ui's CLI.

**Decisions:**
- **Postponed shadcn/ui install.** Theme tokens already existed in `globals.css`, but the CLI/component layer never did. Today's page is fully static, so hand-rolled `Card`/`Badge`/`ProgressBar` primitives cover it with zero new deps. Revisit when the idea-input flow needs a real Dialog (Radix's focus-trap/accessibility behavior earns its keep there, not on static cards).
- **Emoji over icon library.** Mockup only needed 🧠💰🔔👤 — no reason to pull in lucide-react for that.
- **Data flows through props, not direct imports.** Initial Implement pass had dashboard components importing `mock-data.ts` directly. Review flagged this as coupling that would force an edit in every component when real data (Supabase) replaces the mocks. Refine pass moved all mock-data imports up to `page.tsx`, which now passes data down as props — components are pure/presentational.

**Mistake caught mid-session:**
Ran `next build` against the same `.next` directory while `next dev` was still running — corrupted the dev server's webpack module cache (`__webpack_modules__[moduleId] is not a function`, 500 on every route). Not a code bug. Fix: stop the dev server before running a production build, or use separate build outputs. Killing the dev process and deleting `.next` before restarting resolved it.

**Next step:** Day 3 item — design the "New Idea" input flow (this is where shadcn's Dialog/Input actually gets installed and used).

**Quality Score: 88/100**
- Plan/Discuss decisions all traced cleanly into the implementation with no drift.
- Docked for: no visual/screenshot verification of responsiveness (no browser tool available this session, confirmed structurally via Tailwind breakpoints only), and the `next build`/`next dev` cache collision that cost a debugging detour.

## 2026-07-26 — Phase 1, Day 1: New Idea Flow (mock)

**Learnings:**
- Data should flow through props from the composition root, not be imported directly by leaf components.
- Don't run `next build` while `next dev` is live against the same `.next` directory — cache corruption.
- shadcn/ui postponement was the correct call for static cards; confirmed again by shipping a custom Tailwind/React modal without it.
- `Modal` should live in its own client file, not get mixed into `ui.tsx` alongside the server-rendered primitives — keeps unrelated Server Components out of the client bundle.
- First client component (`NewIdeaFlow`) increased page JS from 138B to 1.68kB — acceptable cost for real interactivity.
